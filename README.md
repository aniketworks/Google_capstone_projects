# Projects
This repository holds all my personal projects

Each Project will have hierarchy like:
  1. Raw_data: Folder includes all the CSVs needed for analysis
  2. Anaysis Snips[optional]: Folder includes all the plots that I created as part of analysis using Python libraries
  3. .ppt file[optional]: This file will include PPT that outlines my complete analysis
  4. Main file[optional]: This could be Excel, Jupyter Notebook, RMD File
  
  
## 1. Cyclistic Data Analysis
  
**Tools used:** Python

**Packages used:** Matplotlib for data visualization

** Skills demonstrated:** `Data-Cleaning` `Exploratory Data Analysis` `Data Visulization` `Presentation`

**Summary:**
  
This project was part my Google Data analytics Certification. At the time of course completion I used R for the analysis. Now that I learned Python and
other related libraries, I again did new analysis. My goal was to figure out how Casual and Member riders used Cyclistic Platform differently. By observing Daily, Weekly 
and Monthly trends I clearly logged my observations. Based on these observations I provided my suggestions for marketing strategy in 'Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis.pptx'
